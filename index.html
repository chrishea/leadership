        <b> Leadership Cloudcroft</b> is an educational programs designed to identify and prepare community leaders to address our mountain 
        village's specific challenges. Through monthly classes taught by expert speakers, site visits, and hands-on projects, 
        we strive to share knowledge and insight into the public issues that matter to the Cloudcroft community.   And through this process, help prepare our leaders to best serve the greater Cloudcroft community

                <h1>The Challenge</h1>
                As a small mountain village, Cloudcroft depends on volunteers from the community to lead its local institutions: the government, school board, library, fire department, and numerous committees that help shape its public services.
                Despite these volunteers' critical role, there is no formal effort to identify, recruit, or train these leaders.  Most take office with no background or experience in their new jobs.  That lack of preparation can lead to oversights, mistakes, and missed opportunities.</div>
            <div class="box">
                <h1>The Goals</h1>
                The objective of <b> Leadership Cloudcroft</b> is identify and help prepare community leaders. 
                <br /><br />
                Participants will get a first-hand introduction into the issues facing the Village. 
                The more they learn, the better they can share their knowledge within the community, as well as take effective action as leaders.

            <div class="box"><h1>The Program</h1>
                The Class of 2025 will take place over a five-month period: June through October 2025.  
                There will be five or six class days, each class focusing on a specific topic.
                 <br /><br /> 
                Classes will be held in a centrally-located space in the village, starting in the morning and run through early afternoon.  
                We anticipate getting everyone out by 3 p.m.
                <br /><br />
                Classes are designed to be highly interactive, allowing partiicipants to actively discuss isses with the faculty.  We also anticipate there small working groups will collaborate on assignments to address particular issues.

            <div class="box">
                <h1>The Cirriculum</h1>
               The program focuses on many of the top challenges we face: Governance, Infrastructure, Fire, Economic Development, Healthcare, Schools, and more
                <br /><br />
                We will take a deep-dive on these topics.  The faculty features people who are intimately familiar with a topic and who offer a first-hand look at the challenges and opportunites.  
                <br /><br />
                In some casees, we visit sites to get a look at a situation.  For example, a tour of the Water/Wastewater plant that serves the village.

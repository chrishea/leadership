                <h1>The Challenge</h1>
                As a small mountain village, Cloudcroft depends on volunteers from the community to lead its local institutions: the government, school board, library, fire department, and numerous committees that help shape its public services. Despite these volunteers' critical roles, there is no formal effort to identify, recruit, or train these leaders. 

                  <br /><br /> Most take office with no background or experience in their new roles. That lack of preparation can lead to oversights, mistakes, burnout, and missed opportunities.


            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h1>The Goals</h1>
                The objective of <b> Leadership Cloudcroft</b> is identify and help prepare leaders who are prepared to take charge in volunteer, civic, business, and community roles. 
                <br /><br />
                Participants will get practical knowledge about the issues facing the Village. Class members gain valuable knowledge and insights into the public issues shaping Cloudcroft's future through monthly sessions featuring expert speakers, immersive site visits, and collaborative projects.  
<br /><br />
We hope it will prove an invaluable educational, networking, and motivating resource.

            <div class="box"><h1>The Program</h1>
                The Class of 2025 will occur over five months: June through October 2025. There will be six class days, each focusing on a specific topic.
                 <br /><br /> 
                 Classes will be held in a centrally-located space in the Village, starting in the morning and running til 3 p.m.
                <br /><br />
                Classes are designed to be highly interactive, allowing participants to discuss issues with the faculty actively. We also anticipate small working groups collaborating on assignments to address particular problems.

            <div class="box">
                <h1>The Curriculum</h1>
                The program focuses on our top challenges: Governance, Infrastructure, Fire, Economic Development, Healthcare, Schools, and more.
                    <br /><br />
                    We will take a deep dive into these topics. The faculty features people intimately familiar with a topic and offers a first-hand look at the challenges and opportunities.   <br /><br />
                  In some cases, we visit sites for a first-hand look, such as a tour of the village water/wastewater facilities.
